# Language semantics link tree

For the time being, this wiki will be used to document and design the semantics of the Mangrove language and how the various parts fit together post-parsing to form a cohesive whole.

This is structured as a link tree, with a link off to a wiki page per semantic topic.
This wiki build on top of the language grammar which is described and documented by [mangrove.bnf](https://github.com/mangrove-lang/mangrove-doc/blob/main/mangrove.bnf) in this repo.

## Fundamental types semantics

* [Normal integer semantics](Normal-integer-semantics)
* [Modulo integer semantics](Modulo-integer-semantics)
* [String semantics](String-semantics)
